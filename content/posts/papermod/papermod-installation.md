## What's on the sunny side?

Hi, I'm Maii! 🌞

Sunny side is my online space and porfolio where I put my crafts, hobbies, ideas, and anything under
the sun that I've made for some years now. Sunny side may feature some of my paintings, crocheted crafts,
writings such as short stories and poems and pretty much some random things that I've made so far. It might
not be much or great as others but my crafts hold one thing that others does not have, they carry a part
of me.
