**Ballerina Shoes**   _2021-03-16_

Ballerina Shoes was a school requirement. It was fun because painting is not a daily thing or particularly a hobby
of mine, it was also exciting because we used coffee pigments as our colors. It was pretty challenging because 
I have to find out how will I get various shades of the coffee by measuring how much water will I use in diluting it.
As the shade goes darker, lesser water is added so the texture adds challenge when painting. I did lots of trial and 
error but in the end, I was happy with the result.

**Bloom Valley**   _2021-06-19_

Bloom Valley is my first ever canvas painting. It was a school requirement and we were instructed to paint
on a canvas, I was nervous back then because I never had any experience on painting on a canvas so I was 
afraid that I might mess up (and a canvas is quite expensive so messing up is a huge no-no 🙅🏻‍♀️). After a few 
trials on paper, I began sketching on the canvas and start to hope for the best. It took me 5-6 hrs to finish
the painting and I think it was decent enough for a beginner. I am happy on the end result and proud of my 
hard work 🥳🎉✨.

**Tippy Toes**   _2024-01-21_

Tippy Toes Is another subject requirement. I don't really paint unless it is necessary like for example, a school 
requirement, partly because it is costly but the main reason is that I'm not really drawn to it and it takes so 
much time to accomplish. My life/house situation just don't fit to it. This painting involves a previous theme 
which are ballet shoes, maybe I really do have a thing for ballet, I just find ballerinas awesome. I like how they 
dance and what they do. In fact, if I will be given the chance to do ballet, I would gladly try it though I don't 
think I would do good.
