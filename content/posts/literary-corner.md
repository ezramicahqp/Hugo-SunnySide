# Literaries

Maii's literaries are some of her works from year 2018 up to present year. Her works are mostly poems. They are
mostly about what she feels during the time that she wrote them. A lot of her works are untitled, this is because 
she struggles on thinking of a good title for her pieces.

## _**Horizons for Her**_

I was once at peripeteia  
A point of no return  
The path ahead, uncertain  
Yet looking back, ruins

The fog offers no tender  
The path, certainly uncertain  
Yet the only way is to go on  
With limping courage, so I went  

The walk was long  
My wounds, they're fresh  
With sore, bloodshot eyes  
Once porcelain, now stained cheeks  

Awaiting the dawn took long  
Alone in the dark, I was cold  
Yet the story is long ago, untold  
The sun arrived, the path unfold  

The path was cleared, so is my fear  
The sun is warm, an aiding comfort  
The wind is whispering, "have haope"  
A long dead lantern was fed with spark  

Her broken parts lives within me  
My horizons are promised to her  
To the girl I once knew  
to her, who used to be mine

## _**Untitled, 2024**_

I can't afford to love  
Because I can't afford to lose  
Therefore I can't afford to have  
I grief what i never had  

After losing all of me  
All I have are broken parts  
I'm not good at masking it up  
Yet I still try and pretend  

Decipher me, honey  
Open me, bare  
Till you see my wounds  
Bleeding in despair  

Dive into me  
Beyond my surface level   
Drown with me  
Beyond my surface level

## _**Untitled;**_

Going on circles, the blades are humming  
Artificial wind blows as it fills the space  
I visited an old hobby  
Are we still familiar to each other?  

I always liked how words come together  
Like puzzle pieces, complementing and fitting  
I took pride on putting them together  
Some said I was good but I think otherwise  

It was an unclear identity  
Filled with uncertain motives  
Was I doing it because I was good at it  
Or was I good at it just because  

Nevertheless, it was an occasional friend  
I could bring soul to it  
But never able to put it to flesh  
It is simply what it is and it was fine  

Do we bring comfort to each other?  
I believe no, as a matter of fact  
We simply ran into each other  
Coming back when there's nowhere to run  

As time wilt as we also does  
Becoming strangers to ourselves  
But never to each other  
And I hope we never be  

Merchants suffer bankruptcy  
And I've never been a keeper  
Self dissection has always been my theme  
But regradless of those, do stay

## _**Untitled, 2022**_

For a long time, I was still  
I was standing   
I was there  
Foot cemented on the floor  

It was my place  
It has always been where I should be  
Like a street lamp  
I shed my light, I was still  

Then one day  
I learned that I could move my feet  
For the first time  
I learned that I could walk  

Then began to run  
I was grasping for air  
Nearly choking out of air  
Yet the first time that I breathe  

Maybe that's where it started  
Anywhere became a home  
Anyone became my home  
And home became a stranger  

Running, running  
Running run in my mind  
Run, I must run  
Run, I must do

## _**Carousel**_

Tumunog ang kampana, ala sais  
Sa pagkakaalam ko ay wala namang kamay ang mga tela  
Ngunit mainit,mainit at nanghihele ang yakap ng kumot  
Bumubulong ng uyayi ang unan,pagmulat ng mata'y wala sa pagpipilian  

Tila ibon kung lumipad~,-nakailang kanta na ba ako?  
"Tatlo at kalahati",sabi ng relo, alas otso  
Katabi ko ang araw kanina sa ikalimang kanta ko  
Mata at mga ilaw ay nagtatalik,"kain na~!",sigaw ng araw

Tuyong kanin sa plato, naghihintay sa lababo  
Mga damit sa isang tabi,gustong maitupi  
Wag niyo akong tawagin,wag niyo akong titigan  
Alas dos,mas gusto ko pa kausap ang orasan

Nagpapaalam na ang araw,wala man lang kaming napagkwentuhan  
Isarado ang bintana, magsindi ng katol  
Isayaw ang walis, ipantay ang tubig sa bigas  
Tumunog ang kampana, ala sais

Sarado na ang mga bintana, nakangiti ang kumot at unan  
Bumati ang isang kaibigan, humalik ang kadiliman  
Isa isang sumilay ang mga ilaw, may nagtatawanan  
Siya,ako,sila,nakasakay sa kabayong 'di tumatakbo

Tumunog ang kampana, ala sais  
Bukas,sara,bukas,sara,paulit ulit ang mga mata  
Napagtanto ko ang pagkakapareho ng panaginip at reyalidad  
Tulog man o gising, ako ay nasa Carousel

## _**Hunger**_

Stop pulling the trigger  
A shot could summon all bullets  
Bloodstream filled with caffeine  
And loud reckless beating

Jeopardy is my dinner  
Thoughts as the main ingredient  
Each time of taste was tasteless  
I want to eat another dish

I want to eat my amygdala  
Savor it with desire  
Yet it was a daydream  
It ate me all instead

I am tired of eating  
I want to vomit now  
Vomit my pancreas and intestines   
Puke that hallow organ

Pull all the strings  
Which lies on my shell  
Empty it like a corpse  
And Fill it with formalin   

Yet I will guard my shelter, still  
Will fix every leak  
Will not allow every blink  
Will guard the demons asleep

## _**Sailing**_

Sailing on the lake of swans  
An unending waters  
Casting waves from nowhere  
Turning my ship into a raft  

Deafening yelps from silent battles  
Daggers from my demons  
Thousands of whispers  
Paddling was pointless

With sore torso  
Botflies beneath my skin  
The bitter water was tempting  
Drowning was the only option

The water was cold  
Yet it burned my skin  
Physique with no motion  
Breathing was undefined

Drowning on the cold silence  
It felt no pain or sadness  
Only churning stomach  
And a recorded beating sound

The moon was bright and speechless  
I closed my eyes, waiting  
For an end from my drowning  
Or for the waters to start draining

## _**Kargador**_

Isang sakong mga pangarap  
Dalawang banyerang pangungusap  
Na ang mga latay ay lasap  
At milya milyang tinik patungong alapaap

Nagsisimula ng rumupok ang aking mga buto   
Kumukuba na rin ang likod ko  
Marahil dahil sa pulang bagaheng dala ko  
marahil dahil sa mga laman nito  

Apat na kwaderno mula sa aking pagkabata  
Ang isa ay asul na ang mga pahina ay basa  
Tinta'y humahalo,magulo,humahawa  
Tulad ng nararamdaman ng manunula  

Mayroon ring pula,kulay abo  
At puting pinakaiingatan ko  
Bawat isa'y may kwento  
Na bumubuo sa aking pagkatao  

Isang sakong mga pangarap na hindi lahat ay akin  
Ang kalahati'y sa ilaw at haligi nakalaan  
Na sa bawat estasyon ay nadadagdagan  
Upang maprotektahan,balutin pa ng mga sako ang kailangan

Isang galong pampalubag ng loob sa aking tabi  
Pamatid uhaw kahit man lang konti  
Mula sa mga naririnig at mga muni muni  
Pang ibsan sa sakit ng lalamunan mula sa pagsisisi  

Sampung mga daliri,kamay at paa  
Nagsimula sa paghingi ng tig isa  
Sa mga piraso ng daliri ng aking kamay at paa  
Ngayon tanging palad at talampakan nalang ang  natira  

Kailan magpapakatotoo ang bibig bago ang mata  
Kailan mauuna ang putak bago ang patak ng luha  
Kailan ba gagaan ang dala  
Sana malapit na,sana kayanin ko pa
